1. Plan and design the database:

    -Identify the necessary tables like users, rooms, bookings, etc.

    -Define the relationships between the tables (e.g., a user can have multiple bookings).
2. Set up the development environment:

    Install a web server (e.g., Apache) and a database server (e.g., MySQL).

    Install PHP and configure it with the web server.
3. Create the necessary database tables:

    Use a database management tool (e.g., phpMyAdmin) or run SQL queries to create the required tables based on your design.

4. Develop the user registration and login functionality:

    Create a registration form to allow users to create an account and store their information in the database.
    
    Implement a login form to authenticate users against the stored credentials.

5. Create the user interface:

    Design the web pages for searching availability, selecting dates, and choosing rooms.

    Implement forms to capture user inputs.

6. Implement the CRUD operations for rooms:

    Develop the functionality to list available 
    rooms based on the selected dates.
    
    Allow users to view room details and make a reservation by adding the booking record to 
    the database.

7. Develop the CRUD operations for bookings:

    Create a page to display the user's existing bookings.
    
    Enable users to modify or cancel their bookings.

8. Implement search functionality:

    Develop a search form where users can specify their criteria (e.g., dates, room types) to find available rooms.

9. Implement validation and error handling:

    Validate user inputs to ensure they meet the required criteria (e.g., valid email format, non-empty fields).
    
    Implement error handling to display meaningful error messages to users in case of failures.

10. Implement security measures:

    Protect against SQL injection by using prepared statements or parameterized queries.
    
    Hash and store user passwords securely.
    
    Implement session management to authenticate and authorize users.

11. Test your application:

    Perform thorough testing to ensure all functionality is working as expected.
    
    Test different scenarios, including edge cases and error conditions.
    
    Fix any issues or bugs that arise during testing.

12. Deploy your application:

    Set up a hosting environment and deploy your website.

    Configure the necessary server settings (e.g., database connection details) for the deployed environment.
